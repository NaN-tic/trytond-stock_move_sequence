Stock Move Sequence Module
##########################

The stock move sequence module adds a sequence field in stock moves. In the
input shipments and output return shipments copies the sequence from the input
moves to the inventory moves. In the output shipments copies the sequence from
the output moves to the inventory moves.

If the sale or purchase modules are installed, copies the sequence from the
sale or purchase lines to the stock moves created from them.
